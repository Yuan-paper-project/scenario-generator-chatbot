the other vehicle suddenly merges in front of the ego vehicle
the other vehicle suddenly exits the lane of the ego vehicle
the other vehicle suddenly decelerates in front of the ego vehicle
the vehicle must maintain a stable position and remain within its ego lane across various speeds and curvatures while navigating scenarios where an adjacent vehicle drives close beside it and a leading passenger car or motorcycle swerves within the lane for a while
the ego vehicle encounters a stationary powered two-wheeler positioned directly in the center of the lane when ego vehicle is navigating a highway curve, then ego should detect the object despite the lateral offset of the curve and execute an emergency braking maneuver to avoid a collision
The ego vehicle is traveling in a straight lane when a pedestrian target emerges from the roadside and begins crossing the lane at a constant speed of 5 km/h, forcing the system to calculate a predicted path and decelerate sufficiently to prevent contact
The ego vehicle approaches a section of the road where a motorcycle and a passenger car are stopped sequentially within the same lane, the eg should matain a safe stop 
The ego travels on a stright highway section behind a passenger car that suddenly performs a high-intensity emergency braking maneuver until it reaches a complete stop. The ego vehicle should maintain a safe distance and avoid a collision with the stopped vehicle.
The ego vehicle follows a lead vehicle at a constant speed in a straight lane until the lead vehicle performs a sudden lateral evasive maneuver to change lanes, abruptly revealing a stationary passenger car centered in the original path and requiring the ego vehicle to detect the obstacle and perform emergency braking to avoid a collision
The ego vehicle travels at a constant speed while a passenger car or motorcycle in the adjacent lane executes a cut-in maneuver with varying lateral velocities and longitudinal accelerations, forcing the ego vehicle aviod the collision through braking or deceleration
The ego vehicle follows a lead vehicle at a constant speed in the center of the lane until the lead vehicle suddenly performs an evasive swerve to an adjacent lane, revealing a stationary passenger car target directly in the ego vehicle's path, the ego vehicle should detect the obstacle and brake to a full stop without collision
The ego vehicle follows a lead vehicle in the center of the lane until the lead vehicle performs a sudden evasive maneuver to an adjacent lane, revealing a slow-moving target motorcycle traveling at a significantly lower speed in the same path. The ego vehicle should detect the speed differential and decelerate or brake to maintain a safe distance and avoid a collision
