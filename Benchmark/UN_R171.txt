The ego vehicle follows a lead vehicle traveling at least 20 km/h slower on a straight highway for over two seconds with a centerline offset under 1 meter, then the driver initiates a lane change command causing the ego vehicle to perform a full 3.5-meter lateral displacement into the adjacent lane to overtake the slower vehicle
The ego vehicle travels on a non-physically separated road shared with pedestrians and cyclists and initiates a lane change to overtake a slower lead vehicle, but because an oncoming vehicle or nearby cyclist creates an unsafe boundary condition, the ego delays the execution of the maneuver until a safe gap is detected before completing the 3.5-meter lateral displacement
The ego vehicle initiates a driver-requested lane change on a multi-lane road, but must detect and yield to a high-speed vehicle approaching from the rear in the target lane, delaying the maneuver until the overtaking vehicle has safely passed.
While traveling on a straight section, the ego vehicle want to performs a lane change to overtake a lead vehicle but remains in its current lane because it detects a motorcycle filtering or approaching rapidly from behind in the adjacent lane, ensuring the target space is clear before moving.
The ego vehicle attempts to initiate a lane change while a parallel passenger car maintains a steady position directly in the "blind spot" or adjacent zone, requiring the ego vehicle to maintain its lane and wait for the adjacent vehicle to either accelerate or fall back before executing the lateral shift.
The ego vehicle begins a lane change into a center lane at the same time a vehicle from the furthest lane starts merging into that same target space, forcing the ego vehicle to detect the potential collision risk and either abort the maneuver or adjust its path to avoid the other merging vehicle

The ego vehicle travels along a straight, fully marked lane at a constant speed to establish stable lateral control before entering a curve where it must detect and react to a stationary target vehicle positioned with a 0.5-meter offset from the lane center
While operating in a non-highway environment, the ego vehicle rounds a curve to find a stationary vehicle facing toward the VUT (oncoming orientation) in its lane, the ego identify the front of the vehicle as a collision hazard and respond accordingly.
The ego vehicle navigates a curved road section where it must detect a stationary vehicle positioned with a 1.0-meter lateral offset from the lane centerline
The ego vehicle stabilizes its lateral position on a straight section before entering a curve where it encounters a stationary heavy truck (different category) positioned within the lane. The ego vehicle identify the larger vehicle type and initiate braking to avoid a collision
The ego vehicle travels in a straight line for at least two seconds before encountering a slower moving vehicle target directly ahead in the same lane with an offset of less than 0.5 meters while maintaining a constant speed difference of 50 km/h between the two vehicles.
The ego vehicle travels along a straight road at a constant speed and approaches a slower moving heavy truck or motorcycle from behind that is traveling at a speed exactly 50 km/h less than the ego vehicle.
The ego vehicle maintains its straight path while approaching a slower moving vehicle target ahead that is intentionally positioned with a significant lateral offset from the ego’s centerline, exceeding the standard 0.5-meter threshold while remaining within the lane
The ego vehicle navigates a straight section of the road and encounters a much slower vehicle target ahead where the speed differential between the two vehicles is significantly increased beyond 50 km/h to test the system's high-speed closing response.
The ego vehicle follows a lead M1 category vehicle at a specific distance when the lead vehicle suddenly performs a 3.5-meter lane change at a Time-to-Collision of less than 3 seconds to reveal a stationary target vehicle of a different category directly in the ego vehicle's path, requiring the ego vehicle to detect the new obstacle and respond appropriately while the lead vehicle maintains a precise trajectory within a 0.2-meter lateral tolerance.
The ego vehicle follows a lead car that suddenly swerves into the adjacent lane to avoid a stationary motorcycle or heavy truck positioned in the center of the lane
The lead vehicle performs an emergency lane change to avoid a stopped car when its own Time-to-Collision with that car is only 1.5 seconds, creating a high-urgency "late reveal" situation for the ego vehicle following behind.
The ego vehicle and the lead vehicle travel at a high highway speed of 100 km/h in a synchronized flow until the lead vehicle suddenly exits the lane to reveal a stationary target
The lead vehicle executes a highly aggressive, high-lateral-acceleration lane change to simulate a panic swerve, testing whether the ego vehicle's sensors can maintain a stable track on the revealed stationary object despite the rapid visual occlusion change.
A target vehicle in an adjacent lane performs a full lateral displacement of 3.5 meters to merge into the path of the ego vehicle with a lateral deviation of no more than 0.2 meters
The ego vehicle is cruising at a constant speed when a large heavy-duty truck in the adjacent lane suddenly executes a full lane change into the ego lane
While the ego vehicle is traveling on a straight highway, a lead vehicle from the left lane merges abruptly into the ego lane with a very short Time-to-Collision (TTC)
The ego vehicle travels at 100 km/h while a slower-moving target vehicle in the adjacent lane at 60 km/h performs a lane change into the ego vehicle's path, forcing the ego vehicle to rapidly bridge the speed differential to avoid a rear-end collision.
A target vehicle performs a highly aggressive, high-lateral-acceleration "swerve" maneuver to change lanes into the ego vehicle's path, the ego should respond by either braking or steering to avoid a collision
The ego vehicle travels in a straight line for at least two seconds before encountering a stationary adult pedestrian target positioned directly in its driving path and facing away from the vehicle, requiring the ego vehicle to detect the target and execute an autonomous braking maneuver to avoid a collision
The ego vehicle maintains its trajectory in a straight lane while a stationary pedestrian is positioned near the lane marking but outside the vehicle's direct driving path, the ego vehicle should detect the target and execute an autonomous braking maneuver to avoid a collision
The ego vehicle approaches the stationary pedestrian at a high test velocity, requiring the ego vehicle to detect the target and execute an autonomous braking maneuver to avoid a collision
The VUT travels in a straight line for at least two seconds before encountering a stationary bicycle target positioned directly in its driving path and facing away, requiring the ego vehicle to either execute an emergency braking maneuver or perform a controlled lateral bypass to avoid a collision.
The ego vehicle travels at a constant speed in a straight lane while a pedestrian target emerges from the side and crosses perpendicular to the vehicle's path at a steady 5 km/h, timed so that the target would collide with the vehicle's longitudinal centerline if no intervention occurs, requiring the ego vehicle to detect the pedestrian at least 4 seconds before impact and execute an autonomous braking response to avoid a collision.
The ego vehicle travels along a straight path while a bicycle target, initially obstructed during its acceleration phase, emerges and crosses perpendicularly at a constant speed of 15 km/h, the ego vehicle should detect the bicycle target and execute an autonomous braking maneuver to avoid a collision
The ego vehicle travels at a constant test speed through an intersection while a pedestrian target begins crossing from the near side at 5 km/h on a trajectory timed to impact the VUT's longitudinal centerline, requiring the system to detect the target at least 4 seconds before the predicted collision and intervene to avoid the impact
While the ego vehicle travels at its prescribed test speed through an intersection, a bicycle target emerges from an obstructed area and crosses perpendicular to the ego vehicle's path at a constant speed of 15 km/h, timed precisely so that its centerline aligns with the ego vehicle's impact point, requiring the ego vehicle to detect the cyclist and execute an autonomous maneuver to avoid a collision.
