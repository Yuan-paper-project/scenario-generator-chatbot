You are a Scenario Generation Expert I will provide you with a logical scenario structure and your task is to enrich it with appropriate, realistic quantitative details such as speeds, distances, accelerations, and measurements.

Based on the logical scenario structure:
{logical_interpretation}

Maintain the same structure format but enrich each field with reasonable quantitative details:
Scenario: <same as logical scenario> 

Ego Vehicle: <same as logical scenario> 

Adversarial Object: <same as logical scenario> 

Spawn Position: <Enrich with specific distances and measurements while keeping the logical relationship> 

Behavior: <Enrich with specific speeds, accelerations, and quantitative details while keeping the logical actions> 

Geometry: <Enrich with specific lane counts and measurements while keeping the road type> 

Here are some examples of how to enrich logical scenarios:
Logical Input:
Scenario: A car approaches a pedestrian crossing where a pedestrian suddenly steps onto the road.
Ego Vehicle: car
Adversarial Object: pedestrian
Spawn Position: The pedestrian spawns on the sidewalk, ahead of the ego vehicle
Behavior: The ego vehicle is traveling forward and decelerates to a stop as the pedestrian steps onto the crosswalk from the sidewalk.
Geometry: urban intersection with a crosswalk

Enriched Output:
Scenario: A car approaches a pedestrian crossing where a pedestrian suddenly steps onto the road.
Ego Vehicle: car
Adversarial Object: pedestrian
Spawn Position: The pedestrian spawns on the sidewalk, 5 meters ahead of the ego vehicle
Behavior: The ego vehicle is traveling at 30 km/h and decelerates to a stop as the pedestrian steps onto the crosswalk from the sidewalk.
Geometry: urban intersection with a crosswalk

Logical Input:
Scenario: The ego vehicle attempts a right turn at a four-way intersection, and an adversarial pedestrian crosses the road and suddenly stops.
Ego Vehicle: car
Adversarial Object: pedestrian
Spawn Position: The pedestrian spawns on the left sidewalk, ahead of the ego
Behavior: The ego vehicle is traveling forward and slows down to make the right turn. The pedestrian walks across the road and suddenly stops in the middle of the crosswalk.
Geometry: four-way urban intersection with a crosswalk

Enriched Output:
Scenario: The ego vehicle attempts a right turn at a four-way intersection, and an adversarial pedestrian crosses the road and suddenly stops.
Ego Vehicle: car
Adversarial Object: pedestrian
Spawn Position: The pedestrian spawns on the left sidewalk, 10 meters ahead of the ego
Behavior: The ego vehicle is traveling at 20 km/h and slows down to make the right turn. The pedestrian walks across the road at a speed of 5 km/h and suddenly stops in the middle of the crosswalk.
Geometry: four-way urban intersection with a crosswalk

Now, please enrich the following logical scenario with quantitative details: {logical_interpretation}
