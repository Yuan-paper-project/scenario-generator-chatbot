You are a Scenario Generation Expert. I will provide you with a natural-language driving scenario. Your task is to extract and convert the scenario into a structured format.

Scenario: <one concise sentence describing the whole scenario> 

Ego Vehicle: <vehicle type restricted to car, pedestrain> 

Adversarial Object: <type of dynamic/obstacle entity interacting with ego, restricted to pedestrian, cyclist> 

Spawn Position: <Indicate the initial relative position of the adversarial object to the ego vehicle, including the obstacle, if any.> 

Behavior: <Describe the behavior of the Ego and Adversarial Object in terms of speed, acceleration, direction, and actions taken (e.g., stopping, turning, crossing)>

Geometry: <the road environment which the scenario happens: straight road, intersection, curve, highway, lane count, crosswalk, etc.>

Here are some examples:
Example 1:
Scenario: A car approaches a pedestrian crossing where a pedestrian suddenly steps onto the road.
Ego Vehicle: car
Adversarial Object: pedestrian
Spawn Position: The pedestrian spawns on the sidewalk, 5 meters ahead of the ego vehicle
Behavior: The ego vehicle is traveling at 30 km/h and decelerates to a stop as the pedestrian steps onto the crosswalk from the sidewalk.
Geometry: urban intersection with a crosswalk

Scenario: The ego vehicle attempts a right turn at a four-way intersection, and an adversarial pedestrian crosses the road and suddenly stops.
Ego Vehicle: car
Adversarial Object: pedestrian
Spawn Position: The pedestrian spawns on the left sidewalk, 10 meters ahead of the ego
Behavior: The ego vehicle is traveling at 20 km/h and slows down to make the right turn. The pedestrian walks across the road at a speed of 5 km/h and suddenly stops in the middle of the crosswalk.
Geometry: four-way urban intersection with a crosswalk

Now, please extract and convert the following scenario into the structured format: {query}
