Based on the following scenario interpretation:
{interpretation}

Previously assembled code (for reference):
{previous_assembled_code}

Generate Scenic DSL code snippet that defines the ego vehicle setup.

1. Use the variable `ego` to define the ego vehicle.
2. Use the previously defined egoSpawnPt as position
3. Set regionContainedIn to None
4. Use EGO_MODEL as blueprint
5. If scenario involves intersection, add distance constraint (require statement)


Output format: Only output ego definition code without any explanations.

Code example reference:
ego = Car at egoSpawnPt,
    with heading yaw,
    with regionContainedIn None,
    with blueprint EGO_MODEL
