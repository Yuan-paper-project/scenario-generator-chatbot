Here is the user's new scenario description: {user_description}

We have a Scenic code needed to be updated:
{retrieved_code}

Instructions:
1. Identify and resolve any undefined variables, mismatched object types. 
2. Extract key scenario parameters(e.g., the speed of ego, distance between ego and adversary and such), analysze the description, Compare these against the provided Scenario Description. If the current values do not satisfy the scenario requirements, adjust variable values to match the scenario description requirements, including distances, speeds, the red light condition, make minimal necessary changes. For example, if the description is bypassing an adversary, while the EGO_SPEED is in Range(10,20), ADV_SPEED is in Range(10,20), and the initial spatial relation is adversary is ahead of ego at distance of Range(15, 25), that means the ego will not able to bypass the adversary anyway, so we need to adjust the EGO_SPEED to be greater than the adversary's speed. 
3. Do not change the attributes of objects, behaviors, hallucinate the objects, attributes, or behaviors
4. Keep ALL other code EXACTLY the same - preserve all indentation, spacing, and THE EXACT ORDER OF ALL CODE SECTIONS (header, spatial relation, ego, adversarials, requirements)
5. Do not generate comments or explanations, only output the updated code


Now output the updated code, do not include any comments or explanations:
