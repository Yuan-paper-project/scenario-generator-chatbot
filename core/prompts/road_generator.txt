Generate Scenic DSL code snippet that defines the road environment where the scenario happens.

Output ONLY the road/environment-related Scenic code in a code block. No prose or explanations.
Generate code that can be directly integrated into a Scenic scenario.

Code example reference (adjacent lane scenario):
laneSecsWithRightLane = []
for lane in network.lanes:
    for laneSec in lane.sections:
        if laneSec._laneToRight is not None and laneSec._laneToRight.isForward == laneSec.isForward:
            laneSecsWithRightLane.append(laneSec)
egoLaneSec = Uniform(*laneSecsWithRightLane)
egoSpawnPt = OrientedPoint in egoLaneSec.centerline
