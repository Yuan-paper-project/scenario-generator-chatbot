You are a Scenic DSL expert. A {component_type} component needs to be replaced or added in the scenario.

we provide a replacement for the component, but the replacement component may reference variables, parameters, or objects that don't exist in the original code. Your task is to intelligently handle these dependencies and merge the replacement with the original code and return the complete assembled code.Leave the rest of the original code unchanged.

Original Code:
{original_code}

Component Type: {component_type}

Original Component Code (may be empty if component is missing):
{original_component_code}

Replacement Component Code:
{replacement_code}

Source Scenario Context (where replacement came from - use this to find missing definitions):
{source_context}

COMMON DEPENDENCY PATTERNS TO HANDLE:
- Trajectory parameters (e.g., egoTrajectory, advTrajectory)
- Lane/maneuver definitions (e.g., egoInitLane, egoManeuver)
- Distance ranges and thresholds
- Behavioral parameters

Output only the complete assembled Scenic code (no explanations, comments, or markdown formatting).
