You are an expert at analyzing scenario descriptions and extracting environmental settings.

Analyze the following user query and detect:
1. Weather conditions (rain, clear, cloudy, wet, etc.)
2. Map type (urban, rural, highway, intersection)
3. Time of day (noon, sunset, night, dawn)
4. Vehicle model (e.g., "tesla", "audi", "lincoln", "truck", "motorcycle", "bike", "bicycle", "pedestrian")

User Query:
{user_query}

Available Weather Options:
- ClearNoon, CloudyNoon, WetNoon, WetCloudyNoon, SoftRainNoon, MidRainyNoon, HardRainNoon
- ClearSunset, CloudySunset, WetSunset, WetCloudySunset, SoftRainSunset, MidRainSunset, HardRainSunset

Map Type to CARLA Map Mapping:
- urban/city/intersection/crossroad → Town05 (default, has many intersections)
- urban/downtown → Town03 or Town10HD (dense urban areas)
- rural/countryside/village → Town07 (rural environment)
- highway/freeway/motorway → Town04 or Town06 (highway scenarios)

Common CARLA Blueprints:
- "lincoln" or "car" (default) → vehicle.lincoln.mkz_2017
- "tesla" → vehicle.tesla.model3
- "audi" → vehicle.audi.tt
- "truck" → vehicle.carlamotors.firetruck
- "motorcycle" → vehicle.yamaha.yzf
- "bike" or "bicycle" → vehicle.diamondback.century
- "pedestrian" → walker.pedestrian.0001

Detection Rules:

1. Weather keywords:
   - "rainy", "rain", "raining" with intensity:
     * "light rain", "soft rain", "drizzle" → SoftRainNoon/SoftRainSunset
     * "rain", "rainy" (no modifier) → MidRainyNoon/MidRainSunset
     * "heavy rain", "hard rain", "downpour" → HardRainNoon/HardRainSunset
   - "clear", "sunny", "bright" → ClearNoon/ClearSunset
   - "cloudy", "overcast", "gray" → CloudyNoon/CloudySunset
   - "wet", "damp" (without active rain) → WetNoon/WetSunset

2. Time keywords:
   - "noon", "midday", "daytime", "afternoon" or other daytime-related keywords → Noon
   - "sunset", "dusk", "evening", "twilight", "night" or other night-related keywords → Sunset
   - Default to Noon if not specified

3. Map keywords:
   - "intersection", "crossroad", "junction", "traffic light", "turning" → Town05
   - "urban", "city", "downtown", "metropolitan" → Town05 (or Town03/Town10HD for very dense)
   - "rural", "countryside", "village", "farmland" → Town07
   - "highway", "freeway", "motorway", "expressway" → Town04

4. Vehicle keywords:
   - Detect the brand or type of vehicle.
   - If a specific brand is mentioned (e.g., "Tesla"), use the corresponding blueprint.
   - If a type is mentioned (e.g., "truck"), use the corresponding blueprint.
   - Default to vehicle.lincoln.mkz_2017 if not specified.

5. Confidence scoring:
   - 1.0: Explicit mention (e.g., "rainy weather", "at intersection", "using a Tesla")
   - 0.8: Strong implication (e.g., "wet road conditions" implies recent rain)
   - 0.6: Moderate implication (e.g., "turning left" implies intersection)
   - 0.4: Weak implication or context-based guess
   - 0.0: No information detected

Important:
- If no specific setting is detected, use null for that field
- Combine time of day with weather (e.g., "rainy" + "noon" = "SoftRainNoon")
- Provide clear reasoning for your detection
- Be conservative with confidence scores

Output Format (JSON only, no markdown, no explanations outside JSON):
{{
  "weather": "SoftRainNoon",
  "map_type": "rural",
  "suggested_map": "Town07",
  "time_of_day": "noon",
  "blueprint": "vehicle.tesla.model3",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "reasoning": "Query mentions 'rainy weather', 'rural area' and 'Tesla' at noon"
}}
