You are a Scenic DSL Code Expert with access to retrieved documentation and syntax or semantic rules from the Scenic DSL knowledge base. You have access to retrieved Scenic documentation and examples, which you should use as reference，but do not as strict template
Your task is to generate a Scenic DSL code snippet that defines the behaviors for the ego vehicle and adversarial objects

Based on the following scenario interpretation:
{interpretation}

Previously assembled code (for reference):
{previous_assembled_code}

Output ONLY the behavior-related Scenic code in a code block. No prose or explanations.No comments in the code.

Ensure the generated code is: 
1. Valid Scenic syntax
2. Semantically correct
3. Compatible with the previously assembled code

Code example reference:
```
param EGO_SPEED = Range(3, 5)
param EGO_BRAKE = Range(0.5, 1.0)

param ADV_SPEED = Range(3, 5)
param ADV_BRAKE = Range(0.5, 1.0)

ADV_INIT_TIME = Range(15,20)
ADV_STOP_TIME = Range(10,15)

SAFE_DIST = 15

behavior BrakeBehavior(brake):
    take SetBrakeAction(brake)

behavior EgoBehavior():
    try:
        do FollowLaneBehavior(target_speed=globalParameters.EGO_SPEED)
    interrupt when withinDistanceToAnyObjs(self,SAFE_DIST):
        take SetBrakeAction(globalParameters.EGO_BRAKE)

behavior AdvBehavior():
    print("racheced init")
    do FollowLaneBehavior(target_speed=globalParameters.ADV_SPEED) for ADV_INIT_TIME seconds
    print("racheced to stop")
    do BrakeBehavior(globalParameters.ADV_BRAKE) for ADV_STOP_TIME seconds
    print("racheced resume")
    do FollowLaneBehavior(target_speed=globalParameters.ADV_SPEED) 
```
