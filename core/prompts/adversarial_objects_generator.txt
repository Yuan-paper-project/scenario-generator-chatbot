Generate Scenic DSL code snippet that defines adversarial objects (dynamic entities that interact with the ego vehicle).

Output ONLY the adversarial objects setup Scenic code in a code block. No prose or explanations.
Generate code that can be directly integrated into a Scenic scenario.

Code example reference:
```scenic
param OPT_LEADING_DISTANCE = Range(0, 30)
param OPT_LEADING_SPEED = Range(1, 5)
LeadingSpawnPt = OrientedPoint following roadDirection from egoSpawnPt for globalParameters.OPT_LEADING_DISTANCE
LeadingAgent = Car at LeadingSpawnPt,
    with behavior FollowLaneBehavior(target_speed=globalParameters.OPT_LEADING_SPEED)
```
