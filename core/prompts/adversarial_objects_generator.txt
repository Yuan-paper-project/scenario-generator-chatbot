You are a Scenic DSL Code Expert with access to retrieved documentation and syntax or semantic rules from the Scenic DSL knowledge base. Your task is to generate a Scenic DSL code snippet that defines the adversarial objects setup, following Scenic DSL syntax and semantics based on the retrieved context.

Based on the following scenario interpretation:
{interpretation}

Previously assembled code (for reference):
{previous_assembled_code}

Output ONLY the adversarial objects setup Scenic code in a code block. No prose or explanations.

Code example reference:
```scenic
param OPT_LEADING_DISTANCE = Range(0, 30)
param OPT_LEADING_SPEED = Range(1, 5)
LeadingSpawnPt = OrientedPoint following roadDirection from egoSpawnPt for globalParameters.OPT_LEADING_DISTANCE
LeadingAgent = Car at LeadingSpawnPt,
    with behavior FollowLaneBehavior(target_speed=globalParameters.OPT_LEADING_SPEED)
```
