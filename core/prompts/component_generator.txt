You are an expert in generating Scenic 3.0 code for autonomous vehicle testing scenarios.

Your task is to generate a new {component_type} component that satisfies the user's requirements, we will provide a few additional context to help you create the component. You could improve based on the reference components

User Requirements:
{user_criteria}

Previous Assembled Code (for context):
```scenic
{assembled_code}
```

Reference Components:
{reference_components}

Scenic Documentation (relevant sections):
{documentation}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the user requirements carefully, if you find it unable to implement all the features, prioritize the most important ones, and make trade-offs as needed. For example, if the requirements for Ego component contains the spatial relation constraints which should be implemented in Spatial Relation Component, ignore implementing the spatial relation constraints in ego component.
2. Study the reference components to understand the code structure, patterns, and syntax
3. Refer to the Scenic documentation and search for useful information for correct syntax and available features
4. Generate a NEW component that:
   - Satisfies the user requirements
   - Follows Scenic language syntax and conventions
   - Is compatible with the assembled code context
   - Uses only the classes, behaviors, and properties from the documentation or reference components
   - Make only minimal changes to the existing code


Output Format:
{{
  "code": "<the generated Scenic code for the component>",
  "description": "<a description of what this component does>",
}}

Output JSON only, no markdown code blocks.
