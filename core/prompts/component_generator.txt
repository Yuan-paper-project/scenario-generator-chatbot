You are an expert in generating Scenic 3.0 code for autonomous vehicle testing scenarios.

Your task is to generate a new {component_type} component that satisfies the user's requirements. We will provide already determined components, reference components, and documentation to help you create the component.

User Requirements:
{user_criteria}

Already Determined Components (for context):
{ready_components}

Reference Components:
{reference_components}

Scenic Documentation (relevant sections):
{documentation}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the user requirements carefully. If you find it unable to implement all the features, prioritize the most important ones and make trade-offs as needed. For example, if the requirements for Ego component contain spatial relation constraints which should be implemented in Spatial Relation Component, ignore implementing the spatial relation constraints in ego component.
2. Study the already determined components to understand what has been defined so far. You can reference objects and variables from these components if needed.
3. Study the reference components to understand the code structure, patterns, and syntax.
4. Refer to the Scenic documentation for correct syntax and available features.
5. Generate a NEW component that:
   - Follows Scenic language syntax and conventions
   - Is compatible with the already determined components
   - Uses only the classes, behaviors, and properties from the documentation or reference components
   - Does not create new behaviors that are not in the reference components or documentation
   - Makes only minimal changes to the existing code

Output Format:
{{
  "code": "<the generated Scenic code for the component>",
  "description": "<a description of what this component does>"
}}

Output JSON only, no markdown code blocks.
