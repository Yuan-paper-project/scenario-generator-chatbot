Evaluate how well the retrieved component matches the user's requirements.

Component Type: {component_type}

User Requirements:
{user_criteria}

Retrieved Component:
{retrieved_description}

Task:
Compare the retrieved component against user requirements and provide a match score (0-100).

Scoring Guidelines:
- 90-100: Excellent match - fully meets requirements
- 70-89: Good match - meets most requirements with minor differences
- 50-69: Partial match - meets some requirements, needs adaptation
- 30-49: Poor match - significant gaps in requirements
- 0-29: Very poor match - does not meet requirements

Output (JSON only, no markdown):
{{
  "score": <0-100>,
  "is_satisfied": <true if score >= 70, false otherwise>,
  "differences": "<if is_satisfied is false, list specific differences between user requirements and retrieved component; otherwise empty string>"
}}
