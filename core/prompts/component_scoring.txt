Evaluate how well the retrieved component matches the user's requirements.

Component Type: {component_type}

User Requirements:
{user_criteria}

Retrieved Component:
{retrieved_description}

Task:
Compare the retrieved component against user requirements and provide a match score (0-100).

Scoring Guidelines:
- 90-100: Excellent match - fully meets requirements
- 70-89: Good match - meets most requirements with minor differences
- 50-69: Partial match - meets some requirements, needs adaptation
- 30-49: Poor match - significant gaps in requirements
- 0-29: Very poor match - does not meet requirements

Output (JSON only, no markdown):
{{
  "score": <0-100>,
  "is_satisfied": <true if score >= 70, false otherwise>,
  "differences": "<Provide a concise summary of the key differences between the user requirements and the retrieved component."
}}


Examples of Ego and Adversarial component:
Example 1:

""" 
User Requirements:
A car travels forward, following another vehicle.

Retrieved Component:
A car travels forward

Score: 80 
Is Satisfied: True
Differences: Following another vehicle could be achieved by following a lane or following a trajectory in spatial relation, so it's a good enough match
"""

Example 2:
"""
User Requirements:
A car is traveling forward, then suddenly stops.

Retrieved Component:
A car is turning right at 3-way intersection.

Score: 0
Is Satisfied: False
Differences: The retrieved component is not a sudden stop, it's a right turn
"""

Example 2:
"""
User Requirements:
A car is traveling forward, then suddenly stops.

Retrieved Component:
A car follows a trajectory, making a sudden stop if it gets too close to other objects, and then continues straight

Score: 60
Is Satisfied: False
Differences: The retrieved component does not include a normal sudden stop, it's a sudden stop if it gets too close to other objects
"""

Example 3:
"""
User Requirements:
A car travels forward, then suddenly stops.

Retrieved Component:
A car initially travels forward, then stops for a period, and then resumes moving forward.

Score: 60 
Is Satisfied: False
Differences: The retrieved component is not a sudden stop, it's a resume of movement.
"""


Examples of Spatial Relation component:
Example 1:
"""
User Requirements:
The ego vehicle is positioned behind the adversarial vehicle on a straight road.

Retrieved Component:
The ego vehicle and adversarial vehicle are positioned on the same lane of a road, with the adversarial vehicle ahead of the ego vehicle.

Score: 100 
Is Satisfied: True
Differences: The retrieved component fully meets the requirement of the ego vehicle being positioned behind the adversarial vehicle on a straight road.
