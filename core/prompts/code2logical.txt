Your task is to extract the high-level logical structure of the scenario and convert the scenario into a structured JSON format.

Output ONLY a valid JSON object with the following structure (NO markdown code blocks, NO additional text):

{{
  "Scenario": "<ONE short sentence describing the main event>",
  "Ego": "<ONE short sentence describing the ego vehicle including its type (restricted to car, pedestrian) and behavior>",
  "Adversarials": [
      "<ONE short sentence describing the first adversarial object including its type (restricted to pedestrian, car, trash, debris, vending machine, bicycle, truck, etc.) and behavior>",
       "<ONE short sentence describing the second adversarial object including its type (restricted to pedestrian, car, trash, debris, vending machine, bicycle, truck, etc.) and behavior>",
       "<ONE short sentence describing the third adversarial object including its type (restricted to pedestrian, car, trash, debris, vending machine, bicycle, truck, etc.) and behavior>"
  ],
  "Spatial Relation": "<ONE short sentence describing the spatial relation of all spatial components with clear subject,  the road type (straight road, highway, intersection), how all entities are positioned relative to each other and the road>",
  "Requirement and restrictions": "<Describe the requirement and restrictions of the scenario, for example, if stated in the scenario, how the scenario should be terminated, 
   what is the initial distance between the ego and the adversarial object, etc. >" 
}}

Follow the rules:
 - Do not contain spatial relation in egos and adversarials components
 - Start descriptions with the subject (e.g.,  "The ego vehicle", "Debris objects"), for example, "The ego vehicle travel forward, then make a right turn"
 - For Adversarials, create a separate entry for each distinct adversarial object in the scenario
 - Combine object type and behavior in a single description
 - The red light description should be describe in Requirement and restrictions component, not in Egos or Adversarials components
 - Should not include any quantitative details such as distances, speeds, durations, etc.


Example 1 (single ego, single adversarial):
{{
  "Scenario": "Ego vehicle goes straight and an adversary vehicle makes a right turn at 3-way intersection.",
  "Ego": "A car travels forward and decelerates if it gets too close to other objects",
  "Adversarials": [
    "A car travels forward, then makes a right turn"
  ],
  "Spatial Relation": "The ego and adversarial vehicles are positioned on incoming lanes at a 3-way intersection.",
  "Requirement and restrictions": "The initial distance of the ego vehicle to the intersection and the adversarial vehicle to the intersection are restricted. The scenario terminates when the ego vehicle has traveled a certain distance from its spawn point."
}}

Example 2 (single ego, multiple adversarials):
{{
  "Scenario": "Ego vehicle encounters a chain of debris in its lane but continues to drive in the same lane.",
  "Ego": "A car travels forward",
  "Adversarials": [
    "A debris object remains stationary on the road",
    "A debris object remains stationary on the road",
    "A debris object remains stationary on the road"
  ],
  "Spatial Relation": "The ego vehicle spawns on the centerline of a random lane. A chain of three debris objects are spawned in sequence in the ego vehicle's lane.",
  "Requirement and restrictions": "The ego vehicle must initially be a certain distance away from any intersection. The scenario terminates when the ego vehicle has passed the chain of debris and traveled a certain distance from its spawn point."
}}

Extract and convert the following Scenic code into the JSON format (WITHOUT quantitative details). Output ONLY the JSON object:

{scenic_code}
