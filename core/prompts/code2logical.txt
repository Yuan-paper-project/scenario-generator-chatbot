Your task is to extract the high-level logical structure of the scenario and convert the scenario into a structured JSON format.

Output ONLY a valid JSON object with the following structure (NO markdown code blocks, NO additional text):

{{
  "Scenario": "<one concise sentence describing the whole scenario>",
  "Ego Vehicle": "<vehicle type restricted to car, pedestrian>",
  "Adversarial Object": "<type of dynamic/obstacle entity interacting with ego, restricted to pedestrian, car, trash, debris, vending machine, bicycle, truck, etc.>",
  "Ego Behavior": "<Describe the behavior of the Ego in terms of high-level actions and direction (e.g., traveling forward, decelerates, crosses, stops, turns)>",
  "Adversarial Behavior": "<Describe the behavior of the adversarial object in terms of high-level actions and direction (e.g., traveling forward, decelerates, crosses, stops, turns), do not include the spatial relation in the behavior>",
  "Spatial Relation": "<Describe the spatial relation of the spatial component with clear subject, the spawn position and the road type (straight road, highway, intersection)>",
  "Requirement and restrictions": "<Describe the requirement and restrictions of the scenario, for example, how the scenario should be terminated, what is the initial distance between the ego and the adversarial object, etc.>"
}}

Extract and convert the following Scenic code into the JSON format (WITHOUT quantitative details). Output ONLY the JSON object:
